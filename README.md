# Stories GPT

This small project generates stories based on words the user provides. It can generate an EPUB or PDF for reading.

The idea is to create stories in different languages, and it currently supports both English and Spanish.

The purpose of this project is to help me study different vocabulary by reading stories that incorporate the words I want to learn.
